## 📈 Summary
### 🎯 Performance Metrics
- **📊 Average Requests/sec**: 4,418.21 req/s
- **🚀 Peak Requests/sec**: 29,504.00 req/s
- **✅ Overall Success Rate**: 29.85%
- **💨 Average Throughput**: 259.67 KB/s
- **🌐 Average Latency**: 665.84ms

## 🔍 Key Observations

### ⚠️ Critical Issues
- **🚨 High Connection Failure Rate**: All tools experienced significant connection refused errors, indicating the GoFr server couldn't handle the high connection load (1,000 concurrent connections)
- **📉 Low Success Rates**: Success rates ranged from 1.53% to 78.04%, with most requests failing due to connection issues
- **🔄 Resource Exhaustion**: The server appears to be overwhelmed, likely hitting connection limits or resource constraints

### 📊 Performance Characteristics
- **⚡ Bombardier Performance**: Despite high error rates, achieved the highest peak throughput (29,504 req/s) when connections were successful
- **🐌 Latency Issues**: Average latencies were high across all tools (76ms to 1.13s), with maximum latencies reaching 8+ seconds
- **🎯 Vegeta Stability**: Showed the best success rate (78.04%) but with lower overall throughput

### 🔧 Recommendations
- **📈 Server Tuning**: Increase connection pool limits and worker threads in GoFr configuration
- **⚖️ Load Balancing**: Consider implementing load balancing for high-traffic scenarios
- **🔄 Connection Management**: Optimize connection handling and implement proper connection pooling
- **📊 Gradual Load Testing**: Start with lower connection counts and gradually increase to find optimal thresholds
- **🛠️ Resource Monitoring**: Monitor CPU, memory, and file descriptor usage during load tests

### 💡 Framework Assessment
The GoFr framework shows potential for high-throughput scenarios but requires significant tuning for large-scale concurrent processing. The `/large-process` endpoint appears to be resource-intensive and may need optimization for production workloads.
