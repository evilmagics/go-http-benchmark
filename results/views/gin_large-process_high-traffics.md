## 📈 Summary
### 🎯 Performance Metrics
- **📊 Average Requests/sec**: 5,841.06 req/s
- **🚀 Peak Requests/sec**: 24,208.14 req/s
- **✅ Overall Success Rate**: 32.88%
- **💨 Average Throughput**: 128.37 KB/s
- **🌐 Average Latency**: 659.37ms

## 🔍 Key Observations

### 🚨 Critical Issues
- **Severe Connection Failures**: All tools experienced massive connection refused errors, indicating the server was overwhelmed
- **Low Success Rates**: Success rates ranged from 1.09% to 84.72%, showing the endpoint couldn't handle the load
- **High Error Rates**: 98,906 errors in Bombardier, 180,663 in Go-Wrk, and 2,705 in Vegeta

### 📊 Performance Insights
- **Bombardier**: Achieved highest peak throughput (24,208 req/s) but with catastrophic failure rate (98.91% errors)
- **Go-Wrk**: Moderate performance with consistent ~1s latency, but still high error rate (87.16% errors)
- **Vegeta**: Most stable tool with 84.72% success rate, but lowest overall throughput (589 req/s)

### 🎯 Load Handling Analysis
- **Server Saturation**: The `/large-process` endpoint appears to have severe scalability limitations
- **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Consistent "connection refused" errors suggest server connection limits were exceeded
- **Processing Bottleneck**: High latencies (850ms-1s average) indicate processing-intensive operations

### 💡 Recommendations
- **Reduce Connection Count**: Lower concurrent connections (e.g., 100-500) for better stability
- **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add request throttling to prevent server overload
- **Optimize Endpoint**: Review `/large-process` implementation for performance bottlenecks
- **Add Health Checks**: Implement circuit breakers and health monitoring
- **Scale Infrastructure**: Consider horizontal scaling or more powerful hardware

### 🔧 Test Environment Considerations
- High connection count (1,000) may have exceeded system limits
- Local testing environment may not reflect production capacity
- POST method with large processing requirements created additional overhead
