## 📈 Summary

### 🎯 Performance Metrics
- **📊 Average Requests/sec**: 60,553.73 req/s
- **🚀 Peak Requests/sec**: 100,667.46 req/s
- **✅ Overall Success Rate**: 83.60%
- **💨 Average Throughput**: 9.77 MB/s
- **🌐 Average Latency**: 16.48ms

### 🔍 Key Observations

#### 🚦 Performance Under High Load
- **⚡ Go-Wrk** achieved the highest peak performance at 100K+ req/s but crashed early (4.7s)
- **💥 Bombardier** delivered solid throughput (64K+ req/s) but struggled with connection limits
- **🌿 Vegeta** maintained stability throughout the full 30-second test with 99.99% success rate

#### 🔧 System Limitations Identified
- **🚨 Connection Pool Exhaustion**: All tools experienced connection refused errors at 1,000 concurrent connections
- **⏰ Timeout Issues**: Go-Wrk encountered 269 timeout errors, indicating server saturation
- **📊 Error Rate Correlation**: Higher request rates correlated with increased error rates (Bombardier: 25.5%, Go-Wrk: 23.7%)

#### 🎯 Framework Behavior
- **📈 Beego Performance Ceiling**: Server appears to hit resource limits around 16K sustained req/s
- **🔄 Recovery Patterns**: Vegeta's consistent performance suggests good resource management under sustained load
- **⚡ Burst Capacity**: Framework can handle short bursts up to 100K+ req/s before connection limits

#### 🛠️ Optimization Recommendations
- **🔧 Connection Pool Tuning**: Increase server connection limits and pool sizes
- **⚖️ Load Balancing**: Consider horizontal scaling for sustained high-traffic scenarios
- **📊 Monitoring**: Implement connection pool and resource utilization monitoring
- **🚀 Gradual Ramp-up**: Use progressive load increases rather than immediate high concurrency
