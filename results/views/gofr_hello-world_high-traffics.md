## 🎯 Key Observations

### 🚨 Critical Issues
- **High Connection Failure Rate**: GoFr framework appears to have severe connection handling issues under high load (1,000 concurrent connections)
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Bombardier and Go-Wrk experienced 75%+ failure rates due to connection refusal
- **Inconsistent Performance**: Dramatic difference in success rates between testing tools (22.5% vs 95.96%)

### 📈 Performance Insights
- **Peak Performance**: Bombardier achieved highest request rate (48,576 req/s) but with massive failure rate
- **Stability Trade-off**: Vegeta showed much better stability (95.96% success) but at lower throughput (7,054 req/s)
- **Latency Concerns**: High standard deviation (118.97ms) indicates inconsistent response times
- **Timeout Issues**: Go-Wrk reported additional timeout errors beyond connection refusal

### 🔧 Technical Analysis
- **Connection Pooling**: Framework likely lacks proper connection pooling for high concurrency
- **Resource Limits**: System or application may be hitting file descriptor or socket limits
- **Load Balancing**: Single instance appears unable to handle 1,000 concurrent connections effectively

### 💡 Recommendations
1. **Scale Testing**: Reduce connection count to find stable operating threshold
2. **Configuration Tuning**: Adjust GoFr server configuration for higher connection limits
3. **Infrastructure**: Consider load balancing or horizontal scaling
4. **Monitoring**: Implement detailed error logging to identify bottlenecks

## 📈 Summary
### 🎯 Performance Metrics
- **📊 Average Requests/sec**: 15,306.01 req/s (across successful tests)
- **🚀 Peak Requests/sec**: 48,576.29 req/s
- **✅ Overall Success Rate**: 47.38% (averaged across tools)
- **💨 Average Throughput**: 3.97 MB/s
- **🌐 Average Latency**: 58.70ms

### ⚠️ Status: NEEDS OPTIMIZATION
GoFr framework requires significant optimization for high-traffic scenarios. Current configuration cannot reliably handle 1,000 concurrent connections.
