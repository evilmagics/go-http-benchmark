## 🔍 Key Observations

### ⚠️ Critical Issues Identified
- **🚨 Connection Saturation**: All tools experienced massive connection refused errors, indicating the Echo server was overwhelmed
- **📉 Extremely Low Success Rates**: Success rates ranged from 1.09% to 51.51%, showing severe performance degradation
- **🔴 Resource Exhaustion**: The target endpoint `/large-process` appears to be resource-intensive, causing server instability

### 📊 Tool Performance Comparison
- **💥 Bombardier**: Achieved highest peak throughput (37K req/s) but lowest success rate (1.09%)
- **🌿 Vegeta**: Most stable performance with 51.51% success rate, suggesting better connection management
- **⚡ Go-Wrk**: Moderate performance but suffered from high error rates and long response times

### 🎯 Performance Bottlenecks
- **🔧 Server Capacity**: The Echo server cannot handle 1,000 concurrent connections for this endpoint
- **⏱️ Processing Time**: High latencies (up to 8+ seconds) suggest expensive operations in `/large-process`
- **🔌 Connection Limits**: Consistent "connection refused" errors indicate TCP connection pool exhaustion

### 💡 Recommendations
- **📉 Reduce Concurrent Connections**: Test with 100-500 connections instead of 1,000
- **⚡ Optimize Endpoint**: Profile and optimize the `/large-process` endpoint implementation
- **🔄 Add Connection Pooling**: Implement proper connection pooling and keep-alive settings
- **📊 Load Balancing**: Consider horizontal scaling or load balancing for high-traffic scenarios
